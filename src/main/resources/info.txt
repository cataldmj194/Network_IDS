41. Flag

Last field for training data is Flag. Flag is set to normal unless it has been
categorized into one of the 24 attack types featured in the training dataset:

back dos
buffer_overflow u2r
ftp_write r2l
guess_passwd r2l
imap r2l
ipsweep probe
land dos
loadmodule u2r
multihop r2l
neptune dos
nmap probe
perl u2r
phf r2l
pod dos
portsweep probe
rootkit u2r
satan probe
smurf dos
spy r2l
teardrop dos
warezclient r2l
warezmaster r2l

The 24 attack types are categorized into 4 groups:
1. DOS: denial-of-service, e.g. syn flood;
2. R2L: unauthorized access from a remote machine, e.g. guessing password;
3. U2R: unauthorized access to local superuser (root) privileges, 
        e.g., various ``buffer overflow'' attacks;
4. probing: surveillance and other probing, e.g., port scanning.
